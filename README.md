# Titanic_survivor_prediction
Kaggle Titanic survivor
This is a exercise from Kaggle, before implementing the model i also did an exploratory analysis, about the age of the male/female survivors, the survivor rate among male/female, 
and also the survivor rate by class ticket (first, second and third class). After that i used the Linear Regression model and got an accuracy of 79%
